# R-Type

This project aims to recreate the [R-Type](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type) game and add a multiplayer mode to it. We had to implement a multi-threaded server and a graphical client in [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

We choosed to use an [ECS architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) for our engine.
